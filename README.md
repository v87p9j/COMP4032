Description and Deliverable(s) 
Title 
Evaluating Performance Characteristics of Opportunistic Routing Protocols 
Description 
Report or paper on the investigation of the design, implementation and multi criteria 
performance analysis of two benchmark existing mobile ad hoc DTN network protocols or one new mobile ad hoc DTN network protocol. 
This report will include detailed protocols descriptions, critical analysis of protocol 
performance and comparison across a range of criteria, graphs visualisation and wide 
description on the pros and cons of opportunistic networks being deployed in real world scenarios 
Including suitable references is essential. 
Novelty is essential for the top coursework marks.
